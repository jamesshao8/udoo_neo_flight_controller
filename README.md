# udoo_neo_flight_controller
Quadcopter Flight Controller based on Udoo Neo.


This code is inspired by Udoo-neo-quadcopter and YMFC-3D (brokking.net).

joystick.py runs on ubuntu as the controller, it enables you to control the quadcopter via network using a joystick. (thrustmaster t16000M)

Using an arduino sensor shield would significantly reduce the work of wiring, but some pins has to be removed to adjust with Udoo-neo.

The pid settings should work for F450 with a 4000mAh 3s 25c battery.
